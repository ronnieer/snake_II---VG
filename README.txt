SNAKE II TEAM PROUDLY PRESSENT GAME "SNAKE II"

VARIABLE "setSnakeLength" SHOULD BE SET TO APROPRIATE VALUE 
TO ACIEVE EXPECTED LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY.

AN INTERVAL OF 5 - 15 WILL GIVE AN ENOYING GAME.

THE INTERVAL SETS THE NUMBER OF SEGMENTS OF SNAKE LENGTH THAT
HAS TO BE REACHED TO WIN.

THE PROPERTIE IS TO BE SET IN "Snake_II_game_functions.c" FILE
BEFORE COMPILING THE GAME. DEFAULT VALUE IS 10.


KNOWN ISSUES IS RAND FUNCTION, GIVING A SEMI RANDOM FUNCTION
TO GET THE START DIRECTION OF SNAKE, START POSSITION OF SNAKE,
AND SNAKE'S FOOD POSSITIONING.

THE ISSUE DEPENDS UPON THE RAND() FUNCTION RATHER THAN SRAND(TIME(NULL))
AND SRAND() WAS USED. THE ISSUE IS TO BE SOLVEN IN AN LATER UPDATE.

ENYOY! // SNAKE II TEAM
